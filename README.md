### Introduction
Data science can seem like an intimidating field to get into. I know this first hand. Throughout my journey, I've learned a lot. I've also documented a lot. Through this process, I’ve accumulated a bunch of useful resources that helped me with learning new concepts, doing impactful work, interviewing at top tech companies, and more. This repo is an attempt to ‘open-source’ my experience and insights becoming a data scientist. Enjoy! For more on me and what I'm up to, you can head over to my [website](https://www.conordewey.com/).
